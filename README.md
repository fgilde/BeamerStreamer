## Information
With this project, impressive effects can be created on the wall to match the input signal.

This project was created by me a long time ago when microsoft illumiroom was unfortunately discontinued.

I also never found a good name for the project and never even finished it.
It should be an all-in-one complete solution with a mini projector, remote control and wireless hdmi splitter for the TV.

As a name I thought of IlumiBoom or AmbiWall but as I said I never finished it.

The source is based on WPF and used the USB 2.0 grabber for the sample videos to get HDMI as input source. But everything can be tested and tried out with a webcam or other input device

Maybe someone can start something with it or create something else that makes sense out of it.

As I said, the code is quite old and was just rum, you can also build a lot of things much better.

To see it in Action you can checkout theese YouTube videos
